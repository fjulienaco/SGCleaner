## What Gets Cleaned

The application removes or cleans the following elements to optimize content for LLMs:

### Text Cleaning

- Excessive whitespace and formatting artifacts
- Page numbers and cross-references (e.g., "see page 5")
- Version numbers and dates
- Document metadata references
- Inconsistent bullet points and numbering
- Excessive punctuation

### Structure Optimization

- Converts headings to proper markdown hierarchy
- Standardizes bullet points to markdown format
- Preserves table structure when tables are included
- Maintains logical content flow

## Output Formats

### Markdown

- Structured with proper heading hierarchy
- Tables converted to markdown format
- Clean, readable formatting
- Optimal for LLM processing

### Plain Text

- Simple text format
- Preserves paragraph structure
- Removes all formatting artifacts
- Lightweight output

## Document Analysis

The application provides insights about your document:

- **Paragraph Count**: Total number of paragraphs
- **Table Count**: Number of tables in the document
- **Complexity Score**: Low, Medium, or High based on content volume
- **Style Distribution**: Chart showing paragraph style usage
- **Text Length**: Average paragraph length and total content

## Best Practices

### Input Documents

- Use well-structured DOCX files with clear headings
- Avoid overly complex formatting that isn't essential
- Ensure consistent paragraph styles throughout the document

### Cleaning Options

- Use **Aggressive Cleaning** for heavily formatted documents
- **Remove Tables** if tables contain formatting artifacts rather than useful data
- Choose **Markdown** output for better LLM readability

### Review Process

- Always review the preview before downloading
- Check that important content hasn't been removed
- Adjust cleaning options if needed
